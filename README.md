We choose Document databases Technology because it has the following key features:

=> Data is stored in documents. Documents map to objects which enables us to easily manipulate the contents with the programming languages we are using

=> Document databases have a flexible schema, meaning that not all documents in a collection need to have the same fields. which allows us to create documents in a flexible way.

=> Document databases are distributed, which allows for horizontal scaling (typically cheaper than vertical scaling) and data distribution. Document databases provide resiliency through replication.

=> Querying through an API or query language: Document databases have an API or query language that allows us to execute the CRUD operations on the database.
